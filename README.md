# MAADZ-Project-3:
Our app aims to provide users with a way to search for food in their area while also including ways they can
select their preferences and have restaurants returned that meet those specifications. Afterwards the users can 
"swipe right" or "swipe left" and "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" on the restauraunts that are returned.

# Installation:
The preferred method would be to install it on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foodswipe&rdid=com.foodswipe

Otherwise:

1) Open FoodSwipe
2) react-native run-android
